## Libraries

## System requirements
I have developed this code when I still used Windows 7, but the built-in cmd didn't worked with ANSI colors.

I tested this code in the following systems:
- Windows 10✅;
- Pop!_OS 22.04LTS✅;
- Ubuntu 20.04LTS✅;
- Windows 7 ❌;

## Am I lazy to solve the cross-platform issues?
No, I just want to foccus in developing the main idea before solving those issues.
